# Pray Atia Telegram Mini App 

This is a basic example of integrating a Telegram mini-app with an MPC (Multi-Party Computation) wallet. The goal is to bring more value to the game and the Ronin ecosystem.

In this example, a simple click game is implemented using the Lockbox and Mavis Account service. Both on-chain and off-chain logic are included. Every 10 clicks, the user can claim an amount of RON by calling the smart contract to claim the rewards.
